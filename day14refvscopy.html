        //FUNDAMENTAL TO UNDERSTANDING HOW JAVASCRIPT WORKS- alot of bugs come from not understanding the dif between references and copys- especially when you get into nested data
        //STRINGS AND NUMBERS
        // start with strings, numbers and booleans - values of these go into it and if you change value below it wont update it when defined above
        let age = 100;
        let age2 = age;
        console.log(age, age2); //output 100 100
        age = 200;
        console.log(age, age2); // output 200 100
        // the value of age goes into the variable at the same time

        //same goes for strings
        let name = 'kt';
        let name2 = name;
        console.log(name, name2);
        name = 'llama';
        console.log(name, name2);

        // Let's say we have an array
        const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

        // and we want to make a copy of it.
        const team = players;
        console.log(players, team)

        // You might think we can just do something like this:
        team[3] = 'Lux'
        //updates both team and players to lux.. why?
        //team is not the array- it is just the reference to the original array (players)
        //when you up date any of the arrays, its always going to go back to the reference where it was created
        //different from what happened above with nums, strings and boolers
        //so if you want to make a copy of the array (change array but keep original) you need to make a copy not change actual reference

        // ARRAAAYY
        // however what happens when we update that array?
        // now here is the problem!
        // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
        // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

        // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
        //to make a copy of the array we use slice() this will give us a copy (can also use spread operator now)
        const team2 = players.slice();
        //so now if you were to change team2[3]='lux' - the orinigal players array wil still have poppy

        // one way

        // or create a new array and concat the old one in
        //another way to copy and array is to concat() an existing array into a new one
        const team3 = [].concat(players);

        // or use the new ES6 Spread
        const team4 = [...players];
        //this takes every item out of the iterable array and puts it into this new array

        const team5 = Array.from(players) // yet another way to make a cop
        // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed


        //OBJECTS
        // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
        //cant change the reference object- it will change the original object- have to make a copy of the object
        // with Objects
        const person = {
            name: 'Wes Bos',
            age: 80
        };

        // and think we make a copy:
        const captain = person;
        captain.number = 99;
        //this will just make a reference to the original object and will make another property
        //output { name: 'Wes Bos', age:80, number: 99 }
        //here we made a reference to original one

        // how do we take a copy instead?
        //start with blank object and pass it the object you wish to copy all of the properties from then fold in your new properties you wish to over write

        const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });
        console.log(cap2)
        //now created a new object

        // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
        // const cap4 = {...person};
        //works the same way as spreading an array 
        // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
        //this is sallow in that it will only ever go one level deep- so if you reference an object within an object with object.assign it will change the originial object

        const kt = {
            name: 'kt',
            age: 30,
            social: {
                twitter: '@costantin',
                facebook: '@ktllama'
            }
        };

        console.log(kt);

        const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
        //gives copy of object but if you change the twitter of this copy it changes the originial

        dev.social.twitter = "no"

        //if you need to do a clone you need to get a function and do clone deep- will clone every level asdeep as you want- do you really need to do this?

        //poor mans deep clone
        const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(kt));
        // bc with this you are turing an objec into a string then reassigning it and turing it back into an object
