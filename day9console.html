        //SETTING BREAKPOINT OFF OF AN ELEMENT TO UNDERSTAND JS BEHIND IT
        //to look at the javascript running in your page, inspect > find the element in the DOM the javascript is suspected to be running on (because there is an event change or something) > break on it (left click>breakon>attribute modification)- this will now set a debugger on this element when the js tries to run so you can step into the code (by doing this youre setting a breakpoint)- will show you where the line of code is having the js act on
        //to take off go back to break on in elements panel like before and unselect attribute modification

        console.assert(1 === 1, 'This is false'); // if you run this nothing will show up because its true, 1 === 1
