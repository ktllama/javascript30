        //SETTING BREAKPOINT OFF OF AN ELEMENT TO UNDERSTAND JS BEHIND IT
        //to look at the javascript running in your page, inspect > find the element in the DOM the javascript is suspected to be running on (because there is an event change or something) > break on it (left click>breakon>attribute modification)- this will now set a debugger on this element when the js tries to run so you can step into the code (by doing this youre setting a breakpoint)- will show you where the line of code is having the js act on
        //to take off go back to break on in elements panel like before and unselect attribute modification


        //CONSOLE.ALLLTHESETHINGS LIST
        // Regular
        console.log('consolelog');

        // Interpolated- can interpolate values into it
        console.log('Hello I am a %s string!', 'interpolated'); //dont need as much anymore since we have es6 backticks

        // Styled- use %c to style text- first is the thing you want to style then after the , is the style rules (each rule seporated by ; - last one needs to end with ;)
        console.log('%c styled text here', 'font-size:50px; background:pink; text-shadow: 3px 3px 0 grey;')


        // warning!- give us a warning and tell us the stack trace as to where it got called
        console.warn('this is a warning display');
        // Error :|- wont throw an error will just display an error in the console- with stack trace
        console.error('this is an error display');

        // Info- give you a little bit of info- not working
        console.info('coconuts kill more people than sharks every year');

        // Testing- check if things are true that you console
        console.assert(1 === 1, 'This is false'); // if you run this nothing will show up because its true, 1 === 1
        console.assert(2 === 1, 'this is actually false'); //will only display message if the expression is false

        //can grab an element on a page
        //if class list doesnt contain that it will throw an error
        const p = document.querySelector('p');
        console.assert(p.classList.contains('ouch'), 'that is wrong')
        //so in general you can text for something and if its not there or wrong/ false it will throw an error
        //if its true nothing will happen- so you dont need an if statement

        // clearing- clear the console
        console.clear();

        // Viewing DOM Elements
        //if you console.log a dom element it will show the html in elements
        console.log(p);
        //dir will give you a drop down (apparent so will just console logging it)
        console.dir(p);
        //in here you can look at class list, data set, children, style, prototype methods and all of the other different properties

        // Grouping together- if you were to loop through an array in the console
        dogs.forEach(dog => {
            console.log(`This is ${dog.name}`);
            console.log(`${dog.name} is ${dog.age} years old`);
            console.log(`${dog.name} is ${dog.age * 7} dog years old`);
        })
        //this will console first dog and second dog for first console then continue... if you want to group them so it runs through the entire list of console.log and group it for each dog you write it like this

        dogs.forEach(dog => {
            console.group(`${dog.name}`);
            console.log(`This is ${dog.name}`);
            console.log(`${dog.name} is ${dog.age} years old`);
            console.log(`${dog.name} is ${dog.age * 7} dog years old`);
            console.groupEnd(`${dog.name}`);
        })

        // if you want them to be collapsed on console log you write like this
        dogs.forEach(dog => {
            console.groupCollapsed(`${dog.name}`);
            console.log(`This is ${dog.name}`);
            console.log(`${dog.name} is ${dog.age} years old`);
            console.log(`${dog.name} is ${dog.age * 7} dog years old`);
            console.groupEnd(`${dog.name}`);
        })

        // counting- will count how many times you use a specific word, number, object, dom node, anything 
        console.count('Katie');
        console.count('Llama');
        console.count('Katie');
        console.count('Katie');
        console.count('Llama');
        console.count('Katie');
        console.count('Katie');

        // timing- if you want to see how long something takes
        //first start a timer
        console.time('fetching data');
        fetch('https://api.github.com/users/wesbos')
            .then(data => data.json())
            .then(data => {
                console.timeEnd('fetching data');
                console.log(data);
            })

        //need to pass console.timeEnd the same string that you used to start it

        //table- can take an array of objects and display it in a table0 assuming they all have the same properties it will look nice
        console.table(dogs);
